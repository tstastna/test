*Comparing {github-title} and {gitlab-title}* is like comparing two twins. Two platforms share many features, including:

* Free and paid accounts
* Public and private repositories on all accounts
* Issue and bug tracking
* Collaboration tools
* Permission management
* Project management

The *major differences* are mostly regarding philosophy.

{github-title} emphasizes on high availability and performance of its infrastructure and delegates other sophisticated functionalities to third-party tools.

Conversely, {gitlab-title} focuses on including all features on one well-tested and well-integrated platform; it provides everything for the complete DevOps life cycle under one roof.

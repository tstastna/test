# Git Training Repository

The purpose of this project is for me to learn about Git by resolving issues.

My goals are:

* to familiarize myself with the GitHub interface,
* to practice basic Git workflow - how to make changes and push them to the repository,
* to learn how to collaborate on GitHub - how to do peer reviews,
* to test some advanced Git workflows such as merge conflicts, rebasing (regular and interactive), branching models, cherry-picking, and others, in a safe and controlled environment.

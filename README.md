# Git Training Repository

The purpose of this project is for me to learn about Git by resolving issues.

My goals are:

    *familiarize myself with the GitHub interface,
    *practice basic Git workflow - how to make changes and push them to the repository,
    *learn how to collaborate on GitHub - how to do peer reviews,
    *test some advanced Git workflows such as merge conflicts, rebasing (regular and interactive), branching models, cherry-picking, and others, in a safe and controlled environment.

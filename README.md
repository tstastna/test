# Git Training Repository

The purpose of this project is to learn about Git by resolving issues.

Our goals are:

* to familiarize ourselves with the GitHub interface,
* to practice the usual Git workflow - how to make changes and push them to the repository, 
* to learn how to collaborate on GitHub - how to do peer reviews,
* to test some advanced Git workflows such as merge conflicts, rebasing (regular and interactive), branching models, cherry-picking, and others, in a safe and controlled environment.
